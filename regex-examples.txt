;;A `\Q' sequence causes literal (``quote'') mode to be entered, while `\E' ends literal mode, and returns to normal regular expression processing.

;;ENHANCED FEATURES
\<  Matches the null string at the beginning of a word.  This is equivalent to `[[:<:]]'.
\>  Matches the null string at the end of a word.  This is equivalent to `[[:>:]]'.
\b  Matches the null string at a word boundary (either the beginning or end of a word).
\B  Matches the null string where there is no word boundary.  This is the opposite of `\b'.

\s ;Whitespace
\S ;Non whitespace

\D ;Non digits
\w ;Any alphanumeric
\W ;Non alphanumeric
